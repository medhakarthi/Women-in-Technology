<h1> Influential Women in Technology </h1>
<p> The number of women in IT and technology roles has always been dramatically lower than that of men. Employers are trying their utmost to employ more women in the sector but there seems to be a lack of women entering the tech sector. 
This is mainly due to IT and technology being deemed as a male dominated subject to study at school and therefore
females are choosing alternative subjects to study.</p>
<p> However, there are a number of women senior roles within well-known tech business. Explore through this website to see! </p>

<h1><a name = "sheryl">Sheryl Sandberg - Facebook COO</h1>
